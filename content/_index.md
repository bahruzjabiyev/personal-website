<h2><span class="p-1" style="background-color: khaki">About Me</span></h2>

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" >}}

I am a 4th year Cybersecurity PhD student at Northeastern in Boston, MA. My research advisor is <a href="https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/ek/">Engin Kirda</a>. As a research assistant, my main job is to do an academic research to tackle certain problems in the field of cybersecurity. Particularly, I have been focusing on the issues of Internet Safety and Web Security. 

<h2><span class="p-1" style="background-color: lightgreen">Research Interests</span></h2>
In the first two and a half years of my PhD, I did research on misinformation. I tried to tackle multiple challenges including the detection of fake news articles on the web, detection of fake quote memes on the social media and finally understanding manual fact-checking techniques through textual analysis of fact-check reports.<br><br>Lately, I have been doing research on Web Security problems. I usually explore and work on the prevention of serious attacks targeting web applications and systems.
