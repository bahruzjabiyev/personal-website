### The statement from my advisor

12/7/2020

Re: Paper requirement 

This letter is to confirm that Mr. Bahruz Jabiyev whom I am advising has met the PhD paper requirement set forth by the Cybersecurity PhD program. The paper, titled Preventing Server-Side Request Forgery Attacks, has been accepted at the 36th ACM Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC 2021). This a well-known, respected conference with an acceptance rate of 25%. Bahruz is the lead author of the paper and conducted most of the work with some support from a post-doc. This work introduces a novel approach to prevent server-side request forgery attacks. He implemented this approach by extending the functionality of a popular reverse proxy and deployed multiple web applications with that reverse proxy. He demonstrated that almost all attacks on those web applications are prevented automatically with almost no loss of performance.
