### The statement from my advisor

Re: Paper Requirement

This letter is to confirm that my PhD student Bahruz Jabiyev has met the Ph.D. paper requirement set forth by the Cybersecurity Ph.D. program. The paper, titled "Preventing Server-Side Request Forgery Attacks", has been accepted in the 36th ACM Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC 2021). This is a very well-known, highly-regarded conference with an acceptance rate of about 25%. Bahruz is the lead author of the paper and conducted most of the work with some support from a postdoc student. This work introduces a novel method to prevent server-side request forgery attacks targeting web applications and systems.
